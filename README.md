# Ansible Repository for Infrastructure Management

This repository contains Ansible configurations, playbooks, and roles designed to automate and manage various infrastructure components. Presently, its main focus is on ClickHouse role management. Over time, I anticipate adding more roles and playbooks to provide a comprehensive suite of infrastructure automation tools.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

```
ansible/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/            # Houses Ansible inventory files
â”œâ”€â”€ playbooks/            # Playbooks for diverse automation tasks
â””â”€â”€ roles/                # Ansible roles for various components
    â””â”€â”€ clickhouse/       # Role dedicated to ClickHouse role management
    â””â”€â”€ hadoop/           # Role for deploying HA Hadoop cluster
```



## ðŸš€ Current Roles

### 1. ClickHouse Role Management

This role is tailored for managing roles within ClickHouse. It facilitates the creation, deletion, and privilege granting for roles. For an in-depth understanding, refer to the [ClickHouse role's README](ansible/roles/clickhouse/README.md).

### 2. HA Hadoop Deployment

This role is tailored for setting up a High Availability Hadoop cluster. It manages the installation of Hadoop, setting up the master and worker nodes, and ensures the environment is correctly configured for a HA Hadoop setup. For a detailed overview and configuration guide, check out the [Hadoop role's README](ansible/roles/hadoop/README.md).

## ðŸ“– Usage

1. **Set Up Your Inventory**

   Modify the files within the `inventory/` directory to match your infrastructure.

2. **Execute a Playbook**

   From the `playbooks/` directory:

   ```bash
